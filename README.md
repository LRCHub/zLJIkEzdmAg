```
Co-co-como que se fala co-co-com
Uma mina dessas? Qua-qua-quando eu te vejo
Eu só gaguejo e falo merda
Se-se-sempre que ela cola
Si-si-sinto que tem brecha
Só-só-só que a língua enrola, nem dá bola
Eu falo merda só-só-só que quando querem
É-é eu que fico chato
Não-não sei mais o que eu faço
Será que eu nasci pra tá sozinho?
Necessito de mais testes
Fica um pouco do meu lado
Vai que assim еu paro de fugir
De quem quеr tá comigo
Look at me, I'm in love
When you're around I feel alright
Look at me, I'm in love
Come end my many lonely nights
Look at me, I'm in love
I see it, girl, it's in your eyes
Look at me, I'm in love
I love you, girl, you think I'm fine?
Got me money but this money can't
Buy any love for me
Kinda funny all these numbers
They don't make me anything
Eu sei que eles falam que
Elas vêm pela sua grana
Que a sua cama só tá cheia se a
Carteira tá maior que a sua fama
E a minha fama é relativa
Mas o bolso igual bolacha
Uh, mete a mão lá que 'cê acha
Ca-carteira recheada
Sempre achei que era perigo
Jovem branco sem estilo
Pra atrair só sendo rico
Diamond rings, diamond rings
I can buy you anything
Silver bracelets, some mo' laces
I'ma give you everything
Mesmo assim nunca quis
Escolheu me amar no fim
Essa girl é a certa pra mim
Diamond rings, diamond rings
I can buy you anything
Silver bracelets, some mo' laces
I'ma give you everything
Mesmo assim nunca quis
Escolheu me amar no fim
Essa girl é a certa pra mim
Look at me, I'm in love
When you're around I feel alright
Look at me, I'm in love
Come end my many lonely nights
Look at me, I'm in love
I see it, girl, it's in your eyes
Look at me, I'm in love
I love you, girl, you think I'm fine?
Look at me, I'm in love
Look at me, I'm in love
Look at me, I'm in love
Look at me, I'm in love
Look Look Look at me (Astrus, yeah, yeah)
When you saw me I pulled up in that big body
And then you waited for my
Love in the hotel lobby
Is it real tell me now before I get hurt?
'Cause I could get you Louis
Vuitton with this whole verse
Is it fame or the chains
That you got you mesmerized?
Our love a novela, they should go televise
My friends sayin' that I shouldn't
But I wanna do it
You said you never been in love
I'ma walk you through it
Look at me, I'm in love
(I'ma walk you through it)
Look at me, I'm in love
(You said you never been in love
I'ma walk you through it)
Look at me, I'm in love
(I'ma walk you through it)
Look at me, I'm in lo
(You said you never been in love
I'ma walk you through it)
Look at me, I'm in love
When you're around I feel alright
Look at me, I'm in love
Come end my many lonely nights
Look at me, I'm in love
I see it, girl, it's in your eyes
Look at me, I'm in love
I love you, girl, you think I'm fine?
Look at me, I'm in love
Look at me, I'm in love
Look at me, I'm in love
Look at me, I'm in love
